### üîÑ Development Workflow

```bash
# 1. Setup (one-time)
make setup

# 2. Daily development
make start          # Start all services
make logs           # Monitor logs
make health         # Check service health

# 3. Individual service development
make auth-dev       # Work on auth service
make form-dev       # Work on form service
make response-dev   # Work on response service

# 4. Testing
make test           # Run all tests
make test-auth      # Test specific service

# 5. Deployment
make k8s-deploy     # Deploy to Kubernetes
```
