## üîß Integration Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Services
- **API Gateway**: Fully integrated with comprehensive observability

### üîÑ Ready for Integration
The following services have the shared observability package available and need integration:

1. **Auth Service** (Node.js)
2. **Form Service** (Go)
3. **Response Service** (Node.js)
4. **Collaboration Service** (Go)
5. **Realtime Service** (Node.js)
6. **Analytics Service** (Python)

## üìö Documentation Created

1. **`OBSERVABILITY_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`** - Comprehensive implementation guide
2. **`scripts/start-observability.sh`** - Infrastructure startup script
3. **`scripts/test-observability.sh`** - Integration testing script
4. **Infrastructure configuration files** - Production-ready observability stack

## üéØ Next Steps for Remaining Services

### For Go Services (Form, Collaboration)
```bash
# 1. Update go.mod
cd services/<service-name>
go mod edit -require=github.com/kamkaiz/x-form-backend/shared@v0.0.0
go mod edit -replace=github.com/kamkaiz/x-form-backend/shared=../../shared
go mod tidy

# 2. Update main.go
# Add observability provider initialization and middleware
# (See API Gateway implementation as reference)
```

### For Node.js Services (Auth, Response, Realtime)
```bash
# 1. Install OpenTelemetry packages
npm install @opentelemetry/api @opentelemetry/sdk-node @opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node
npm install prom-client

# 2. Create observability module
# 3. Integrate with Express/Fastify middleware
```

### For Python Services (Analytics)
```bash
# 1. Install OpenTelemetry packages
pip install opentelemetry-api opentelemetry-sdk opentelemetry-exporter-otlp
pip install prometheus-client

# 2. Create observability module
# 3. Integrate with FastAPI/Flask middleware
```

## üîç Testing Your Implementation

### Basic Health Check
```bash
# Start API Gateway
cd services/api-gateway
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=api-gateway OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318 go run ./cmd/server

# Test endpoints
curl http://localhost:8080/health
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics
```
